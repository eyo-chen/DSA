// numOfUnplacedFruits places fruits into baskets following specific rules and returns

// Algorithm:
// - Process fruits in order from left to right
// - For each fruit, find the leftmost available basket with sufficient capacity
// - Mark used baskets as unavailable (-1) to prevent reuse
// - Count successful placements and return the difference
//
// Time Complexity: O(nÂ²) where n is the length of arrays
//   - Outer loop: O(n) to process each fruit
//   - Inner loop: O(n) to find suitable basket in worst case
//
// Space Complexity: O(1) excluding input arrays
//   - Uses constant extra space, modifies input array in-place
