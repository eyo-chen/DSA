# Problem Explanation

The idea to solve this problem is to use a hash table to count the frequency of each character in the magazine. Then, we iterate through the ransom note and check if the character is in the hash table and if the frequency is greater than 0. If it is, we decrement the frequency of the character in the hash table. If the frequency is 0, we return false. If we successfully iterate through the ransom note, we return true.

However, this approach is not efficient because it uses a hash table to count the frequency of each character in the magazine. We can use an array to count the frequency of each character in the magazine. This is because the characters in the magazine are only lowercase English letters. So, we can use an array to count the frequency of each character in the magazine.

In Go, when you use a for loop with range on a string, it iterates over the Unicode code points of the string, not the bytes. Each code point is represented by a rune in Go.

A rune is an alias for int32 and is used to represent a Unicode code point. This is important because:
It correctly handles multi-byte characters (like emoji or non-ASCII characters).
It allows for easy arithmetic operations with character values.
In this code, the operation s - 'a' is using rune arithmetic to convert the lowercase letter to an index (0-25) in the table slice. This works because:
'a' has a Unicode value of 97
'b' has a Unicode value of 98, and so on
So 'b' - 'a' = 1, 'c' - 'a' = 2, etc.
This arithmetic wouldn't work correctly if we were dealing with raw bytes instead of runes.
Using runes ensures that the function works correctly for any valid Unicode string, not just ASCII. However, in this specific case, the function assumes that all characters are lowercase English letters, so it would need modification to handle a broader range of characters.


# Complexity
## Time Complexity O(n + m)
- n is the length of the magazine
- m is the length of the ransom note
- We iterate through the magazine to count the frequency of each character, which takes O(n) time.
- We then iterate through the ransom note to check if we can construct it, which takes O(m) time.
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n + m).

## Space Complexity O(1)
- We use a table of size 26 to count the frequency of each character in the magazine.
- Therefore, the space complexity is O(1).
- Or we use slice of size 26 to count the frequency of each character in the magazine.
- Therefore, the space complexity is O(1).
